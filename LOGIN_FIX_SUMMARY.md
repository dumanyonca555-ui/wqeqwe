# Login Redirect Issue - Resolution Summary

## Problem
The login page was not redirecting to the main menu after successful login.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Character Profile Creation File**
   - The main-menu.php was redirecting to `/profile-creation.php` when users didn't have a character profile
   - This file didn't exist, causing a 404 error

2. **Database Schema Mismatch**
   - The database schema had `character_name` column but the application expected `name`
   - The application expected `avatar_url` but database had `avatar`
   - Missing required fields: `zodiac`, `age`, `favorite_color`, `default_emoji`

3. **Incomplete Database Setup**
   - Original database script had inconsistencies
   - INSERT statements referenced columns that didn't exist

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Profile Creation Page
- **File**: `/profile-creation.php`
- Provides a form for users to create their character profile
- Includes all required fields (name, backstory, zodiac, age, favorite_color, default_emoji)
- Properly redirects to main menu after profile creation

### 2. Fixed Database Schema
- **File**: `/backend/database/essential_tables.sql`
- Updated `character_profiles` table structure to match application expectations:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE character_profiles (
      id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
      user_id INT NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,           -- Fixed: was character_name
      backstory TEXT,
      avatar_url VARCHAR(255),             -- Fixed: was avatar
      zodiac VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Leo',    -- Added
      age INT DEFAULT 25,                  -- Added
      favorite_color VARCHAR(7) DEFAULT '#7b9fff',  -- Added
      default_emoji VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'ðŸŒŸ',       -- Added
      created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
      FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
      INDEX idx_user (user_id),
      INDEX idx_name (name)
  );
  ```

### 3. Database Setup
- Created clean database setup that creates all required tables
- Added test user with proper character profile
- Ensured all foreign key relationships work correctly

## Test User Credentials
- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Password**: `testpassword`

## Login Flow Now Working
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. If credentials are valid, session is created
3. User is redirected to main menu
4. Main menu checks for character profile
5. If profile exists, main menu loads successfully
6. If profile doesn't exist, user is redirected to profile creation page
7. After profile creation, user is redirected back to main menu

## Files Modified/Created
- âœ… `/profile-creation.php` - New file
- âœ… `/backend/database/essential_tables.sql` - New clean database schema
- âœ… `/backend/database/celestial_tale_clean.sql` - Complete database schema (backup)
- âœ… `/backend/database/update_character_profiles.sql` - Update script
- âœ… `/setup_database.sh` - Database setup script

## Database Commands to Reset
If you need to reset the database:
```bash
mysql -u root -e "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS celestial_tale; CREATE DATABASE celestial_tale CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
mysql -u root celestial_tale < backend/database/essential_tables.sql
```

## Issue Status: âœ… RESOLVED
The login page now successfully redirects to the main menu after authentication.
