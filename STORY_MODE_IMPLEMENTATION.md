# Neural Network Story Mode Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the 10-chapter story mode for the Neural Network interactive visual novel game. The implementation includes all dialogues, character interactions, choice points, and affinity changes as specified in the detailed scenario guide.

## Database Structure

The story mode content is stored in three main tables:

1. `story_chapters` - Contains chapter information
2. `story_dialogues` - Contains all character dialogues
3. `story_choices` - Contains player choices and their effects

## Content Summary

### Chapters

1. **Başlangıç** (15:30) - Initial character introductions with Leo and Chloe
2. **Tanışma** (18:30) - Meeting Felix and Elara
3. **İlk Görev** (21:30) - Team mission briefing
4. **Gizem** (00:30) - Late night discovery with Leo and Chloe
5. **Hacking Challenge** (03:30) - Chloe's solo technical challenge
6. **Grup Yemeği** (06:30) - Morning routine with Felix
7. **Mentörlük Seansı** (09:30) - Personal development session with Elara
8. **Kriz Yönetimi** (12:30) - Major crisis and team decision point
9. **Kişisel Anlar** (15:30) - Character-specific romance development
10. **Final Confrontation** (18:30) - Climactic ending with multiple routes

### Characters

- **Leo** - The Strategist
- **Chloe** - The Hacker
- **Felix** - The Heart
- **Elara** - The Mentor

### Routes

The story mode features four distinct character routes based on player choices and affinity levels:

1. **Leo Route**
2. **Chloe Route**
3. **Felix Route**
4. **Elara Route**

Each route has unique dialogues and romantic scenes in Chapter 9.

## Implementation Details

### populate_story_mode.php

This script populates the database with all story content:

- Inserts all 10 chapters with their unlock times and descriptions
- Creates 284 dialogues across all chapters
- Implements 136 player choices with affinity changes
- Links dialogues to choices to create branching narrative paths
- Implements all four character routes in Chapter 9
- Includes the climactic Chapter 10 with multiple ending variations

### Test Scripts

- `test_story_retrieval.php` - Verifies that content can be retrieved from the database

## Technical Features

### Affinity System

Each choice affects character affinity scores:
- Positive choices increase affinity (1-5 points)
- Negative choices decrease affinity (-1 points)
- Different characters have different affinity values for the same choice

### Timed Chapter Unlocking

Chapters are scheduled to unlock at specific times:
- Chapters 1-2 are unlocked by default
- Chapters 3-10 unlock every 3 hours of game time

### Branching Narrative

The story features multiple branching paths:
- Major decision point in Chapter 8 affects which character route is pursued
- Chapter 9 content varies based on the chosen route
- Chapter 10 has multiple endings based on player choices

## Content Statistics

- **Chapters**: 10
- **Dialogues**: 284
- **Choices**: 136
- **Character Routes**: 4
- **Total Playtime**: ~90 minutes
- **Replay Value**: Multiple endings and romance routes

## How to Use

1. Run the database setup scripts to create the necessary tables
2. Execute `populate_story_mode.php` to insert all story content
3. Verify the content with `test_story_retrieval.php`

## Future Enhancements
